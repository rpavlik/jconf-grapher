jconf graphing tools

Project Status
--------------

This worked to some degree when I last used it.
However, I have moved on, no longer need this, and have no capacity
to meaningfully maintain it.

**Unmaintained**

Intro
-----
At its core, this is a program to parse [VR Juggler][1] jconf
configuration files and output [Graphviz][2] "dot" language input, which
can be parsed by the Graphviz tools to create a human-usable map of the
components and relationships in the configuration files. VR Juggler
configurations have several layers of abstraction and indirection
(devices, device proxies, proxy aliases) and this tool can help make the
relationships clearer.

A GUI for exploring the rendered output is included.

Requires
--------
* Python 2.x, at least 2.5 Python 2.5 (uses `xml.etree.ElementTree` to
	parse the XML-based jconf files)

* Graphviz (dot) tools to convert the output into an image - not
	technically required but for any reasonable usage you want this.

	* Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install graphviz`

	* Windows: You can use the installer from <http://www.graphviz.org>.
		You may need to reboot so that graphviz is in your PATH. To
		test, click Start, Run, and enter `dot`. If you see an error,
		it's not in the path. If it opens a black window and just sits
		there, then you're good to go. (Just close the window manually.)
	* Mac with [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/):
		`brew install graphviz`      

* Additional dependencies for the minimal `jconf2pdf` wrapper script:

	* Bash shell - you probably already have this on any *nix system.

* Additional dependencies for the GUI viewer `jconf-viz`:

	* GTK+ and PyGTK 2.10 or greater

		* Windows: Depending on the version of Python you installed,
			choose and install the matching "all-in-one" installer from
			<http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html>. The default install
			options are correct.

		* Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install python-gtk2`
  		
		* Mac with [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/):
  			download [pycairo.rb](https://raw.github.com/jscasallas/homebrew/master/Library/Formula/pycairo.rb),
			[pygobject.rb](https://raw.github.com/jscasallas/homebrew/master/Library/Formula/pygobject.rb) and
			[pygtk.rb](https://raw.github.com/jscasallas/homebrew/master/Library/Formula/pygtk.rb)
			to /usr/local/Library/Formula. Then `brew install pygtk`.
                        

Details
-------
`jconf-viz.py` is a GUI application for exploring a visualization of a
jconf file. You can pass a file at the command line, or open one in the
GUI. Click a node to make it the center, left-drag in a blank area or
middle (wheel) drag anywhere to move, use the scroll wheel to zoom. It
will auto-reload to reflect file changes at most once a second.

(Mac users: you need to use X11 to execute the application
to do so, right click on `jconf-viz.py`>"Open With">"Other...".
Make sure "All Applications" is selected in the "Enable:" dropdown menu,
choose /Applications/Utilities/X11, check the "Always open with box"
and click on Open.)

`jconf2dot.py` takes as parameters one or more jconf files. It prints
Graphviz ("dot") format descriptions of the relationships in the jconf
files to standard output, which you can redirect to file or pipe right
to the `dot` executable.

`jconf2pdf` is a simple shell script wrapper for jconf2dot. It passes
along its arguments to jconf2dot, pipes the output to dot, and saves a
PDF to the name of the first input file with ".pdf" appended. It's very
minimal: if you want different output, just look at it as a guide - the
"works" is really just a one-line pipeline.

Output Diagram Key
------------------

* Grey filled ovals: proxy aliases
* Outlined ovals: device proxies
* 3D Boxes: other elements, assumed to be decives
* "Egg" shapes: Users
* Dotted-bordered boxes: Elements defined in a particular file. Nesting
	of boxes shows inclusion.
